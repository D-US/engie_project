# engie_project

To build this API, I use the Flask since I found it easy to use

## Installation

### Installation of the Flask library

More details on the installation of [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/2.2.x/installation/) to install Flask.

```bash
pip install Flask
```
### Download the project (via git clone, through the zip)
```bash
git clone https://github.com/D-US/engie_project.git
```

#### Run the project
Open the CMD on the project folder
```python
python api_file.py
```

Next step go to postman and test the API


## Usage

### The API is accessible through the port: 8888,  the route: productionplan, and the method: POST
On a local machine and while using postman (on the post method) you can add for exmple link http://127.0.0.1:8888/productionplan

### Test on POSTMAN

##### METHOD: POST

#### HEADER
    * KEY :  Content-Type
    * VALUE : application/json

#### BODY
    Choose binary and import one of the payload.json file. (You can find some payload file inside the folder powerplant-coding)
