To build this API, I use the Flask since I found it easy to use

## Installation

### Installation of the Flask library

More details on the installation of [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/2.2.x/installation/) to install Flask.

```bash
pip install Flask
```
### Download the project (via git clone, through the zip)



## Usage

### The API is accessible through the port 888 and the route : productionplan 
on a local machine and while using postman (on the post method) you can add for exmple link http://127.0.0.1:8888/productionplan

```python
import foobar

# returns 'words'
foobar.pluralize('word')

# returns 'geese'
foobar.pluralize('goose')

# returns 'phenomenon'
foobar.singularize('phenomena')
```
